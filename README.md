The application is running at https://macstackrory.github.io/development/
   The goal of this application is to display bakery items in a way that the user can sort and filter them based on their needs. The user can add items to their cart and see the total price at the bottom of the page.
The user can filter items based on allergies and type of product as well as sort the items alphabetically or from lowest to highest price. 
Each bakery product has it's own FoodItem component which has price, type, and allergy props as well as others. The state updates based on user input by clicking or filtering or soring buttons. Users can also add or remove buttons to their cart which impacts state. 
The webpage is organized so that the filters and sorting buttons are at the top and the cart is at the bottom, so the most important part (the baked goods) are in the middle.
